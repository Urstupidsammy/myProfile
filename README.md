Title: My Portfolio

Description:

For this week I was instructed to create a portfolio showcasing any projects that I have worked on so far. Since I do not have much experience with develooping my portfolio has some placeholder images until I am able to update it. However, my website has multiple links to any of my socials in order to contact me. Along with a nav bar that users can interact with to take them to my portfolio showcase, where my first week assignment is shown.
